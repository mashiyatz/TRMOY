### Introduction

This Reminded Me of You is an interactive scene where the player is a mutual friend of the two creators, Mashi and Jo. Scattered across the player’s living room are myriad books that Mashi and Jo have gifted the player over the course of years. Each book contains an inscription from either Mashi or Jo explaining why they thought to give the book to their friend. As the player pores through the covers, recurring themes emerge around gender roles, the weight of responsibility, and the joy of friendship. The aggregate effect is a quiet sense of kinship between the player and each of the creators that can reveal just as much about the hypothetical recipient as the givers.

### Gameplay

To navigate the scene, the player will begin at a start screen that provides a bit of context. After clicking through, the player will enter their own living room, where they can mouse over the books positioned on the table, shelves, and TV console. Upon clicking, a close-up of the book will appear alongside a handwritten note from Mashi or Jo. An audio recording of the note will play at the same time. The player need only click once to exit the pop-up and continue exploring more books. 

Players are free to engage with the room for as long as it takes them to find all of the books, or they can leave it as is for the next player to explore. Hopefully, they're interested in the books we recommend.
